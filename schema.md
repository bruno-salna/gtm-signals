# Shared Row Schema

This is the output format for every repo in the series: Market map → List quality → ICP + tiering → Signals → Orchestrator. Each repo reads and writes rows in this format, which is what lets them chain. Each repo also works on its own.

## Rules
- **File:** CSV, UTF-8, comma-separated, one header row. Keep the original characters in names (ä, ł, ō …); don't strip accents.
- **Column names:** `snake_case`, exactly as listed below.
- **Empty means unknown.** Never fill a field with a guess. A blank field is honest; a wrong value spreads into every later step.
- **One row per legal entity,** identified by `country` + `register_id`. Lists from other sources may not have a `register_id` yet; the List quality repo adds `quality_row_id` so every row can still be referred to.
- **Don't drop columns you don't use.** Later repos may need them.
- **Add only within your prefix.** Each repo owns a prefix for any columns it adds (see the end of this file).

## Columns written by the Market map

### Identity
| Column | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `country` | text | ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code, e.g. `DE`, `PL` |
| `register_id` | text | The company's identifier in the national register. Store it as text so leading zeros survive. |
| `legal_name` | text | Name exactly as registered. Cleaning happens in the List quality repo. |
| `legal_form` | text | Legal form as the register writes it, e.g. `GmbH`, `sp. z o.o.` |
| `status` | text | Status as the register writes it |
| `status_normalised` | text | One of `active`, `inactive`, `in_liquidation`, `unknown` |
| `registered_date` | date | `YYYY-MM-DD` |

### Classification and place
| Column | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `industry_code` | text | Primary activity code as registered |
| `industry_code_system` | text | Which classification and version, e.g. `NACE Rev. 2.1` or the national variant |
| `region` | text | First-level region as the register writes it |
| `city` | text | City or municipality |

### Size and web
| Column | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|

### Market map fields
| Column | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|

Lists that didn't come from the Market map can leave `in_market`, `excluded_by` and `segment` empty.

## Columns kept from the input
Input columns that don't map to the schema are kept at the end of the file, with the prefix `src_` and their original name in `snake_case` (e.g. `Reg. No.` → `src_reg_no`). The original value of any field that was changed (an ID, a domain) is also kept here. Nothing from the input is lost.

## Columns other repos add
| Repo | Prefix | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| List quality | `quality_` | see above |
| ICP + tiering | `icp_`, `tier` | see above |
| Signals | `signal_` | see above |
| Orchestrator | `run_` | `run_id`, `run_step` |
| (input columns) | `src_` | kept as they came, see above |
